# Data Cleaning in SQL
In this SQL project, I focused on cleaning the Nashville Housing Dataset. The primary objective was to enhance the dataset's quality and reliability for subsequent analysis. The project began with importing the dataset into a SQL database, ensuring proper table structures were in place. Utilizing SQL queries, the dataset was thoroughly examined to identify and address common data cleaning challenges such as missing values, inconsistencies, and duplicates. Through strategic use of SQL functions and operations, the date format was standardized to remove the timestamp, missing data and null values were filled where appropriate, the property address column was split into individual columns for address, city and state by using joins, and redundant entries were eliminated.
